The course project for Practical Machine Learning course.

1) Getting and cleaning the data. Firstly columns with NA were removed from "train" data frame.
Then only columns common with "test" data frame columns were considered. And "classe" column. (total 52+1 columns left in "train" data frame)
2) Splitting "train" data frame into "train1" and "cValidation" data frames at 3/4 and 1/4 proportions respectively.
3)Random forest model was selected for training and prediction.
train(classe ~., method="rf", data=train, trControl=trainControl(method='cv'), number=5, allowParallel=TRUE )
4)Accuracy of training and crossvalidation set and missclassification rate were calculated. 
Accuracy is 99.55%.
5)Prediction for "test" data frame was composed.
